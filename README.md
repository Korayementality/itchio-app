**This project is in very early development!**

Built with Qt 5. To build and run the project you'll need to install Qt and [Qt
Creator](http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:Tools::QtCreator). Open the `pro`
file and click run.

itch.io app is cross-platform for Windows, Linux, and OSX.


## Coding style

`astyle` is used to format the codebase. The 1TBS preset is used. To format all
source files run:


```bash
$ make format
```
